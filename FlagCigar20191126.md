1. Explain BAM FLAG value： 143
Read paired,read mapped in proper pair,read unmapped,mate unmapped, second in pair
2. Explain BAM FLAG value： 99
Read paired,read mapped in proper pair, mate reverse strand
3. Explain BAM FLAG value：516
Read unmapped, read fails platform/vendor quality checks
4. Explain BAM FLAG value： 2064
Read reverse strand, supplementary alignment
5. Explain BAM FLAG value： 147
Read paired,read mapped in proper pair, read reverse strand, second in pair
6. Explain BAM CIGAR：14M2D31M
Based on the reference sequence,14 bases matched, 2 deleted, 31 matched
7. Explain BAM CIGAR：3S6M1D5M
Based on the reference sequence,3 bases soft clipping (clipped sequences present in SEQ),6 matched,1 deleted,5 matched
8. Explain BAM CIGAR: 6M14N5M
Based on the reference sequence,6 bases matched,14 skipped,5 matched
9. Explain BAM CIGAR: 7M5D8M2I14M  (小写：7m5d8m2i14m）
Based on the reference sequence,7 bases matched,5deleted,8 matched,2 inserted,14 matched
10. how long is the read with alignment CIGAR of 7M5D8M2I14M?
31
